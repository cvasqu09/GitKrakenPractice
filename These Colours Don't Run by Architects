These Colours Don't Run by Architects
These streets aren't paved with gold.
Don't believe everything that you're told.
Deception hides in all you see.
Corruption hangs in the air that you breathe.
And in the land of the free.
You know nothing comes for free.
Fourth drive in paradise.
Vapid souls check the market price.
Life time slave
Living in a suburban grave
If there was a god, was a god,
You would be the death of him.

These colours don't run,
Like colours from the face,
Eyes roll back chemical despair,
It's true what they say life isn't fair.
